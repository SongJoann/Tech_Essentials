<h2> more about me </h2>
<p>
    I am a Korean-American millennial based in L.A., with a penchant for photography, painting, and writing. I’m an obsessive problem solver. I enjoy figuring out ways to make processes more efficient.
    Currently, I’m a Master’s student at USC’s Iovine and Young Academy and an Automation Engineer at ZipRecruiter. 
    I like exploring new places and dabbling in creative projects. I wrote a children’s book about the pandemic from a corgi’s perspective during 2020. 
    The book was a tribute to our family’s late corgi and to the little anchors who kept us going during the pandemic.
